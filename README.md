# Propr Plugin for Mozilla Developers
This is a Firefox Plugin for Bugzilla and Mozreview to collect data from Mozilla developers when they are reviewing patches in order to determine common features of "good" code changes.

The plugin can be found in the Mozilla Firefox Add-ons Store here: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/propr/.
